Email related processes are handled by two entities (activity and comment)
They constitute the core of Task Management System

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Email that is sent is derived from message (content) and constructed as Activity entity (mailing_list_activity)

**Workflow**

Workflow (mailing_list_activity_workflow) states on Mailing List Activity should only be changed by system (in code).
States that describe quality of response (eg. Not Held / Rejected) are attached to Comment which represents response.
FOI law has SLA (Service Level Agreement) of 20 days and our states have to be aware of that. Time directly influences state.

**Activity States: that are set by transactional email service via webhook**

- Inactive/Pending Canceled
- Inactive/Pending Pending
- Inactive/Pending Delivery Error
- Inactive/Pending Rejected (TODO this state)
- In progress Sent = Awaiting response
- In progress Seen = Awaiting response
- In progress Delayed = Awaiting response
- In progress Awaiting Classification Response / Received **Any matching response will set activity to state**
- Finished Successfully
- Finished Successfully with delay
- Finished Unsuccessfully (because unsatisfactory answer and timed out )
- Finished Expired (because Timed out)
- Finished Need more info

**TODO Begin**
 ACTIVITY_STATUS_REJECTED is undefined
 Maybe rename all const, eg. ACTIVITY_STATUS_PENDING to ACTIVITY_STATUS_EMAIL_PENDING ?
**TODO End**


dmt_mail handles incoming emails and webhook requests from Mailgun.

[Mailgun webhook settings](https://app.mailgun.com/app/webhooks) should be configured to point to
`[domain]/webhook/mailgun`

When a valid webhook event occurs data is placed in 'dv_mailgun_webhook' Queue

Currently webhook data is serialized and saved as revision_log_message in activity.
**TODO** save data as **collect** entity

## Usecase 1
As a Journalist I want to gather data so I can make insights into logic behind smart government decisions.

**Roles**
- S - System
- J - Journalist
- W - Worker (can be program or a human)

**Scenario**
- S: Email is imported
- S: Comment is created and attached to proper Activity
- S: Comment state is set to _Awaiting classification_
- S: Create Notification
- W: Sets State to comment
- W: Translates email text into proper data type field (number / list) in comment

**Email Workflow States**

- Awaiting classification
- Rejected : Possible Action - Needs admin attention
- Needs admin attention = Awaiting classification (Request internal review)
- Partial success = Successful (?)
- Not an FOI request  = Successful
- Not Held = Successful
- Successful

To calculate score we will merge all states into 4 possible
- Awaiting classification / In progress (answer was not yet moderated = ignored)
- Successful (satisfactory answer was given in time)
- Partially Successful (Partially Answered or Answered with Delay)
- Rejected (non-satisfactory answer was given)

**Explanation**
Eg. When institution replies by saying that they do not hold requested information then Worker must either agree with institution and set answer to **Not Held** or Reject Response.

If Response is Delayed (not received by required time), System creates activity_comment and sets it to Rejected state (?)

Maybe we could immediately create empty comment and set it to Awaiting response (?)

### Needs admin attention Process

## Question Content Type

Question = Task = Action entity states

Category: Eg - Suggestion, Compliment, Bug, Question, Task

States:

- New / Pending_approval - Ako je source FB ili twitter onda prvo ide u taj state
- Draft
- Open
- Active
- Closed

There are comments which are general messages and activities as tasks.


Comment state - "More info" po tome se automatski kreira komentar koji se šalje instituciji
"Praise" šalju instituciji komentar
